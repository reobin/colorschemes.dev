It was quite nice, \nwith only two annoyances:\n\n- Bright white on jet black was a bit off-putting.\n- There were cases when I did miss the lack of color, vimdiff for \n  example.\n\nTherefore, I aimed to find or create a colorscheme to solve these two \nissues.\n\nThe result is very much based on the [pencil][] colorscheme, which is \nsurprising because it's a very colorful colorscheme, but:\n\n- It uses a very sane approach to defining and setting colors\n- It has nice background and foreground colors\n- In the areas where I do want color, I like how it colors things\n\n[pencil]: https://github.com/reedes/vim-colors-pencil\n\n![Screenshot](shot.png)\n\nSlightly out of date, not super exciting...\n\n## Installation\n\n- Use [Vundle][]\n- Add \"pbrisbin/vim-colors-off\" as a plugin\n\n[vundle]: https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n:colorscheme off\n```\n\nSupports both `background=light` and `background=dark`.\n", "image_urls": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbrisbin/vim-colors-off/master/shot.png"], "latest_commit_at": "2017-02-12T15:40:41Z"}
