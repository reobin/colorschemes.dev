It\u2019s easy for your eyes and\ndesigned to keep you in the zone for long programming sessions.\n\nZenburn has been ported to many different editors and environments. For more\ninformation and list of derivatives, visit http://kippura.org/zenburnpage\n\n### No:\n\n  - dayglo vomit\n  - black, red, blue and green on screaming white background\n  - headache\n  - watery, squinting eyes\n  - the \"I wanna run away\" feeling\n\n### Yes:\n\n  + alien fruit salad\n  + harmonious colors help with concentration\n  + improved focus\n  + stay longer in the zone\n  + more productivity\n  + looks good\n  + 256-color terminal mode\n  + GVim mode\n  + customizeable\n  + etc.\n\n### INSTALLATION\n\nTo use Zenburn in GVim, simply copy the file to colors/ subdirectory under your\nVim configuration folder (e.g. `~/.vim/colors` or `C:\\vim\\colors`).\n\nTo use Zenburn in Vim, you must enable the 256-color mode for Vim. This can be\ndone with e.g. `export TERM=xterm-256color`. You might also need to add \n`set t_Co=256` into your `.vimrc` file, before loading the colorscheme. Note, that\ndue to limitations of the 256-color mode the color scheme is not exactly like\nit appears in GVim, but very close nevertheless.\n\nTo load Zenburn in Vim/GVim:\n\n  `:colors zenburn`\n\nTo automatically load the colors upon startup of Vim, add this to `.vimrc`:\n\n  `colors zenburn`\n\n### LICENSE\n\nGNU GPL, http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\n\n### DEVELOPERS\n\nCaptain Obvious says: make a symlink from `~/.vim/colors/zenburn.vim` which\npoints to the real `zenburn.vim`. This way you don't need to copy files around\nand making the Vimball is easy!\n\n### MAKING A VIMBALL\n\nTo make a Vimball, open `zb-vimball.txt` and then `:MkVimball zenburn.vba`\n\n### THANKS\n\n  * Creators of \"BlackDust\", \"Camo\" and \"Desert\" themes. I used those to figure out\nhow the Vim color schemes work in practise.\n  * All contributors - see `zenburn.vim` for a list.\n  * All people who made derivatives and ports.\n  * All zenburners worldwide!\n\n### PARTING WORDS\n\nThank you for enjoying \u201cJust some alien fruit salad to keep you in the zone\u201d!\n\nCheers,\nslinky at iki dot fi", "image_urls": [], "latest_commit_at": "2020-01-23T21:16:02Z"}
