It's been in my dotfiles repo, but it should really be in its own repo.\n\nFor more info, see: http://blog.toddwerth.com/entries/8\n\nI've also included my IR_Dark and IR_Blue. I use all 3 depending on the situation.\n\nI also made an IR_Black for OSX Terminal here: http://blog.toddwerth.com/entries/6\nand one for Textmate here (wow, in 2007, crazy): http://blog.toddwerth.com/entries/2\n\nThere are many other ports of IR_Black for everything from XCode to Java IDEs etc. Google has tons of them.\n\nHappy coding.\n", "image_urls": [], "latest_commit_at": "2012-03-05T21:39:41Z"}
