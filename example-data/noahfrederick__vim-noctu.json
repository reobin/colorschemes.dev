Rather than specifying\nparticular color values for Vim, I prefer to have consistent colors across\n*all* software that I use in the terminal (e.g., colored output from git,\ntmux's status bar, etc.). Towards that end, this scheme is restricted to 16\nANSI colors (0 through 15), the representation of which can be redefined by\nconfiguring your terminal emulator. This means that you can change your color\nscheme \"globally\" without having to edit this script.\n\nThe color scheme has been tested against the following file types:\n\n- CSS\n- Git (commit messages, etc.)\n- HTML\n- JavaScript\n- LESS\n- Markdown\n- PHP\n- Ruby\n- Shell\n- Vim help\n- Vim script\n- Vimwiki\n- XML\n- YAML\n\n## Appearance\n\nHere's what Noctu looks like in OS X's Terminal.app with a custom theme:\n\n![Screen shot of Terminal](example.png)\n\nNotice that vim, tmux, and the output from git-log share the same palette.\n\n## Installation\n\nJust stick `noctu.vim` in your `colors/` directory, or if you manage your\nplug-ins with [pathogen][1]:\n\n\tgit clone git://github.com/noahfrederick/vim-noctu.git ~/.vim/bundle/noctu\n\nYou can find the latest version of this scheme in the [GitHub repository][2].\nIf you're looking for a color scheme for GUI Vim, you may be interested in\n[Hemisu][3] by the same author.\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen\n[2]: https://github.com/noahfrederick/vim-noctu\n[3]: https://github.com/noahfrederick/Hemisu\n", "image_urls": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noahfrederick/vim-noctu/master/example.png"], "latest_commit_at": "2015-06-27T02:39:52Z"}
