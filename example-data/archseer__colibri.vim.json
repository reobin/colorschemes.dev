You can [preview the color palette here](https://archseer.github.io/colibri.vim/swatch.html).\n\nI've always appreciated color schemes, but felt that they often\nadd more visual clutter than I needed (using more than a few colors distracts my\neye and makes the file look more [like a box of crayons](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/syntax2.png)).\n\nI wanted a color scheme that would be minimal, look good at all times of the\nday, and work well with f.lux at night.\n\nColibri is a genus of hummingbird, which inspired the base colors for this\nscheme (long story short, I sampled these colors from a photograph of\na hummingbird for a web UI project that I never ended up finishing).\n\n## Design rationale\n\n1. Different colors should be used minimally as a way of visual cues. Use\n   similar handpicked shades to introduce subtle contrast.\n2. Regular text should complement the background; [pure white or pure black\n   overpower](https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/) and should\n   be used sparingly to draw attention.\n3. Start minimal, tweak often, introduce colors as needed.\n\nI use the complement green for constants to introduce some contrast, especially\nfor elixir/ruby symbols (I think it could be a bit subtler, but that's the best\ncomplement green I found after 10-20 iterations).\n\nI was using/working on this color scheme for a while from my dotfiles\nrepository, you can see a [fuller commit history\nhere](https://github.com/archSeer/dotfiles/commits/77758f6675381ec5123438b385700a8ba11fb33c/vim/colors/colibri.vim).\n\n## Installation\n\n```vim\n\" vim-plug\nPlug 'archseer/colibri.vim'\n\" NeoBundle\nNeoBundle 'archseer/colibri.vim'\n\" Vundle\nPlugin 'archseer/colibri.vim'\n```\n\nIf you don't use a plugin manager just copy the content of vim/colors/ to ~/.vim/colors.\n\nWhen you have the plugin installed, you can set it in your vimrc:\n\n###### For 24 Bit Terminals\n```VimL\nset termguicolors\nset background=dark\ncolorscheme colibri\n```\n\n###### For GUI\n```VimL\nset background=dark\ncolorscheme colibri\n```\n\nThere is some support for a 256 color version, but the colors are much cruder.\nThere is an experimental light version of the scheme, `set background=light` to\ntest it out.
