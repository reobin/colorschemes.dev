Scroll down to see!\n\n`vim-sublime-monokai` is a refined Monokai color scheme for `vim` tries to look\nlike Sublime's default color scheme. It's derived from the work put into:\n\n* [sickill/vim-monokai](https://github.com/sickill/vim-monokai)\n* [crusoexia/vim-monokai](https://github.com/crusoexia/vim-monokai)\n\nI noticed that there were several places where the highlighting wasn't entirely\nfaithful to that of Sublime, which is my second choice for editing in my\nday-to-day. The purpose of this project is to provide an experience that\nmatches Sublime as closely as possible.\n\nNote that, in my case, I use several plugins to enhance my own highlighting and\n`ctags` experience. Where possible, the dependent plugins have been noted for\nlanguages whose highlighting would otherwise be impossible to make equivalent\nto Sublime. Conflicts with other plugins that I've used have been noted. You\nwill NOT get full fidelity with Sublime's highlighting if you use conflicting\nplugins with this color scheme enabled.\n\n## Installation\n\nUse your favorite plugin manager! Alternatively, download the\n[`colors/sublimemonokai.vim`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erichdongubler/vim-sublime-monokai/master/colors/sublimemonokai.vim)\nfile and move it into your `colors` folder.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installing this plugin via your favorite plugin manager, add the\nfollowing to your `vimrc`:\n\n```viml\nsyntax on\ncolorscheme sublimemonokai\n```\n\nInside of [`sublimemonokai.vim`](./colors/sublimemonokai.vim) one will find\nnotes and suggested variations from exact Sublime colors that contributors have\nfound to be superior to vanilla Sublime. It is recommended that you take a look\nand see if there's anything you like! Deficiencies in syntax highlighting\nsupport that make it impossible to achieve parity with Sublime have also been\nnoted. These are prime candidates for PRs if you find a plugin with better\nsyntax highlighting groups!\n\n## Terminal support\n\n`vim-sublime-monokai` only support 256 colours in terminal. If you are using a\nterminal which support truecolor like **iterm2**, enable the GUI color by\nadding the following to your `vimrc`:\n\n```viml\nset termguicolors\n```\n\nOtherwise, use below setting to activate the 256 color in terminal\n\n```viml\nset t_Co=256\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Italics\n\nBy default italicized text is enabled in GUI (gVim), but in terminal it's not.\nIf you are using a font that support italics in terminal, add the following\nto your `.vimrc`:\n\n```viml\nlet g:sublimemonokai_term_italic = 1\n```\n\n## Language-specific configuration\n\nIn order to provide an experience with parity to Sublime, this color scheme\nintegrates with the highlighting groups that several language-specific plugins\nspecify. You will need to install these plugins in order to have Sublime-like\nhighlighting.\n\n### Java\n\nThere are two flavors you can pick from here -- see below sections for more\ndetails.\n\n#### Mainline `vim`'s Java\n\n![Mainline `vim` Java](screenshots/java-vim-mainline.png)\n\nThis is the recommended option for Java. You will need at least the following\nconfiguration for proper color support:\n\n```viml\nlet java_comment_strings=1\nlet java_highlight_functions=1\nlet java_highlight_java_lang_ids=1\n```\n\n#### Using `vim-java`\n\n![Using `vim-java`](screenshots/java-vim-java.png)\n\n1. [`vim-java`](https://github.com/rudes/vim-java) for the core language\n\n### Javascript\n\n![Javascript](screenshots/javascript.png)\n\n1. [`vim-javascript`](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript) for the core\n    language\n2. [`vim-javascript-lib`](https://github.com/crusoexia/vim-javascript-lib), for\n    popular Javascript libraries, like [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)\n    and [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/).\n\n#### Conflicts with Javascript\n\n* [`cSyntaxAfter`](https://github.com/vim-scripts/cSyntaxAfter) conflicts on\n    many operator groups.\n\n### Go\n\n![Go](screenshots/go.png)\n\n1. [`vim-go`](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) for the core language\n\n    You will need at least the following configuration for proper color\n    support:\n\n    ```viml\n    let g:go_highlight_format_strings = 1\n    let g:go_highlight_function_arguments = 1\n    let g:go_highlight_function_calls = 1\n    let g:go_highlight_functions = 1\n    let g:go_highlight_operators = 1\n    let g:go_highlight_types = 1\n    ```\n\n    The following are also provided as options by `vim-go` and are handled\n    gracefully:\n\n    ```viml\n    let g:go_highlight_extra_types = 1\n    let g:go_highlight_fields = 1\n    let g:go_highlight_generate_tags = 1\n    let g:go_highlight_variable_assignments = 1\n    let g:go_highlight_variable_declarations = 1\n    ```\n\n    This should cover all options provided by `vim-go` pertaining to\n    highlighting. If you notice that this is out-of-date, please submit a PR!\n\n### PHP\n\n![PHP](screenshots/php.png)\n\n1. [`StanAngeloff/php.vim`](https://github.com/StanAngeloff/php.vim) for the\n    core language\n\n    You will need at least the following configuration for proper color\n    support:\n\n    ```viml\n    let g:php_var_selector_is_identifier = 1\n    ```\n\n## Other Screenshots\n\n### HTML\n\n![HTML](screenshots/html.png)\n", "image_urls": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErichDonGubler/vim-sublime-monokai/master/screenshots/go.png", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErichDonGubler/vim-sublime-monokai/master/screenshots/html.png", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErichDonGubler/vim-sublime-monokai/master/screenshots/java-vim-java.png", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErichDonGubler/vim-sublime-monokai/master/screenshots/java-vim-mainline.png", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErichDonGubler/vim-sublime-monokai/master/screenshots/javascript.png", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErichDonGubler/vim-sublime-monokai/master/screenshots/php.png"], "latest_commit_at": "2020-02-28T23:27:54Z"}
