Color schemes\nare a very subjective topic -- we don't all have the same taste.\n\n**If you're going to send a pull request that you want me to merge, please post\na comment in it with before/after screenshots!**\n", "image_urls": ["http://i.imgur.com/fQGGC.png", "http://i.imgur.com/LgLar.png", "http://i.imgur.com/THHz7.png", "http://i.imgur.com/J56VS.png"], "latest_commit_at": "2020-02-19T02:00:14Z"}
